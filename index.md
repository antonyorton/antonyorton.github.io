This website provides links to some projects I have created.

The motivation is learning, and trying to conquer the world. The latter is a work in progress, and the former will always be a work in progress, perhaps more an instinct than a carefully thought out plan.

### [PileResponse.jl](PileResponse.jl/dev)

A Julia package for assessing the axial load displacement response for a single pile based on cone penetration test results.

A tutorial can be found here: [Tutorial.](PileResponse.jl/dev/tutorial/)\
A Pluto notebook can be found here: [Notebook.](cpt-pile)

### [Numerical conformal mapping](conformal-map)

A notebook showing a mapping of a unit disk to an arbitary shaped polygon. The process follows an algorithm described in:

- _Schwarz Christoffel Mapping_ by Driscoll and Trefethen (2005).

Future ideas include the generation of flow nets for confined groundwater flow beneath sheet piles.

### [Southern hemisphere satellite imagery](https://ortons-weatherapp.vercel.app)

This is an app I created which provides live 24hr satellite data based on images provided by the Japan Meteorological Agency.

The app uses AWS lambda functions and runs in _look at me, no hands_ mode, meaning it needs little to no maintenance.
